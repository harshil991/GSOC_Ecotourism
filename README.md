ðŸ§ª Test Results
âœ… Test 1 (Easy): Platypus Occurrence Mapping
For this test, platypus occurrence data for the year 2024 was downloaded from the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA). The data was filtered to include only sightings within Australia and for the specified year. A spatial map was created to visualize the locations of these sightings, providing an initial understanding of the speciesâ€™ distribution across the country in 2024.

âœ… Test 2 (Medium): Weather Data Extraction Using GSODR
In this test, the GSODR package was used to retrieve one year of daily weather dataâ€”including temperature and precipitationâ€”from a weather station located in Victoria, Australia. The selected station is situated near regions with a high density of platypus sightings. This data will support further analysis of environmental conditions that may influence platypus activity.
